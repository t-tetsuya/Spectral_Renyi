The main code of the estimation using spectral divergences is "Main_SpecRenyi.R".

The exact simulation methods for AR1 and ARMA(p,q) processes and a spectral simulation method for stationary time series with some given spectral density function are implemented in "SimTS.R". 

The spectral density functions for ARMA(p,q) processes and Brune's model and their derivatives are implemented in "SPD.R". 

The gradient descent method for the PIS (Pinsker-Itakura-Saito) divergence and the spectral Renyi divergence is implemented in "SpecDiv.R".
